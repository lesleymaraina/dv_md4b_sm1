Dashboards are a multi-layer system:

- **Data ingestion**: clinical, genomic, imaging, registry, or trial data
- **Transformation layer**: cleaning, harmonization, feature engineering
- **Visualization layer**: static ggplot objects, reactive views, linked panels
- **Interaction layer** filters, sliders, linked brushing, drill-down

## <span style="font-size:80%">From Plot to System</span> {.smaller}

- Data layer should be independent from the visualization layer
- Visualization code should never contain raw data
- Rationale, improves:
  - Reproducibility
  - Maintainability
  - Transparency
  - Testability

SEER*Explorer: Cancer Incidence Dashboard

 -Visualization tool showing cancer incidence and survival data collected by the National Cancer Institute’s SEER Program
- SEER collects incidence and survival information across multiple regions over decades, forming the evidence base for epidemiology, public health policy, and clinical research
- allows users to explore trends by cancer type, age, sex, race, and geographic region

SEER*Explorer: Cancer Incidence Dashboard - Data Layer vs. Visualization Layer

- underlying cancer data (incidence counts, population denominators, survival rates) is managed independently from the visualization code
- ensures that the data can be cleaned, validated, and pre-processed once and reused across multiple views without risk of ad-hoc error

## <span style="font-size:80%">Biomedical Data Pipelines</span> {.smaller}

- biomedical data pipelines ensure that the information being displayed is accurate, consistent, and interpretable
- dashboards rely on clean, standardized, and well-processed data
- without normalization, harmonization, quality filtering, and derived variables, visualizations could be misleading or inconsistent conclusions across cohorts
- performing these steps upstream and version-controlling the pipeline, dashboards can provide visual summaries that support biomedical decision-making

- **normalization** : 
  - controls for technical variability (like sequencing depth in RNA-seq) to ensure meaningful biological comparisons
  - process of adjusting raw data so that it can be compared across samples or experiments [i.e.: TPM (Transcripts Per Million): normalizes RNA-seq read counts]

- **harmonization**: 
  - ensures consistency across datasets so they can be integrated and analyzed together
  - aligning or mapping data from different sources to a common standard or ontology
  - e.x.: mapping diagnosis codes from ICD (International Classification of Diseases) to categories

- **quality filtering** : 
  - removing or flagging unreliable or low-quality data points before analysis
  - protects analyses from biases or errors caused by poor-quality data
  - e.x.: checking adverse event (AE) coding for consistency

- **derived variables**: 
  - new variables created from raw data to summarize or categorize information
  - facilitates higher-level analyses, modeling, or clinical interpretation
  - e.x.: risk scores: e.g., cardiovascular risk calculated from age, blood pressure, cholesterol

## <span style="font-size:80%">Applied Example</span> {.smaller}

- normalization, harmonization, quality filtering, and derived variables can be upstream preprocessing concepts in a biomedical data pipeline
- cBioPortal provides : example where each of these pre-pipeline step are directly visible in the dashboard interface
- cBioPortal : interactive web-based platform for exploring and analyzing cancer genomics and clinical data

## <span style="font-size:80%">Applied Example</span> {.smaller}

- integrates sequencing data (mutations, copy number alterations, structural variants) with clinical annotations across large cancer cohorts
- every panel in cBioPortal—mutation burden plots, gene frequency tables, cancer type summaries—reflects upstream data processing choices

## <span style="font-size:80%">Summary</span> {.smaller}

- interactive dashboards are multi-layer analytical systems that integrate : data ingestion, transformation, visualization, and interaction layers
- effective dashboards depend on upstream biomedical data pipelines that ensure data are accurate, consistent, and interpretable before visualization
- normalization, harmonization, quality filtering, and derived variables are essential preprocessing steps that prevent misleading comparisons and spurious conclusions

## <span style="font-size:80%">Summary</span> {.smaller}

- SEER Explorer illustrates how separating the data layer from the visualization layer improves reproducibility and transparency
- cBioPortal demonstrates how these pipeline decisions become directly visible in dashboard components $\rightarrow$ every plot and table reflects prior data processing choices rather than raw data
